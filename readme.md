# DifferDB

DifferDB is an online application which is able to compare two MySQL databases, show the differences and sync the changes. DifferDB is final product of my Thesis at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.

## Step one: create databases
Create two database connections and save them at your account. The login credentials are safely stored using AES and a HMAC.

## Step two: diff the databases
Diff the databases.

## Step three: check and select the differences
Check the differences and select the ones you'd like to process.

## Step four: Execute
Create SQL queries or execute them directly. You can also sync multiple databases at the same time.

# To-Do
- Create API for integration with Amazon CodeDeploy
- Handle diffing of column orders
- Create dependency system (because some queries are dependent on other queries)
